# Issue tracker: GitHub

Issues and PRDs for this repo live as GitHub issues. Use the `gh` CLI for all operations.

## Which repo

This clone has **two** GitHub remotes:

- `origin` → `vmxmy/wechat-article-exporter` — **this is where issues live**
- `upstream` → `wechat-article/wechat-article-exporter` — upstream project, do not write to it

`gh` infers the repo from remotes and may resolve to `upstream` or prompt interactively,
which stalls non-interactive agent sessions. **Always pass `--repo vmxmy/wechat-article-exporter`
explicitly** on every `gh issue` / `gh label` / `gh api` call.

## Conventions

- **Create an issue**: `gh issue create --repo vmxmy/wechat-article-exporter --title "..." --body-file <path>`.
  Use `--body-file` for multi-line bodies; heredocs mangle backticks and CJK punctuation.
- **Read an issue**: `gh issue view <number> --repo vmxmy/wechat-article-exporter --comments`,
  filtering comments by `jq` and also fetching labels.
- **List issues**: `gh issue list --repo vmxmy/wechat-article-exporter --state open --json number,title,body,labels,comments --jq '[.[] | {number, title, body, labels: [.labels[].name], comments: [.comments[].body]}]'`
  with appropriate `--label` and `--state` filters.
- **Comment on an issue**: `gh issue comment <number> --repo vmxmy/wechat-article-exporter --body "..."`
- **Apply / remove labels**: `gh issue edit <number> --repo vmxmy/wechat-article-exporter --add-label "..."` / `--remove-label "..."`
- **Close**: `gh issue close <number> --repo vmxmy/wechat-article-exporter --comment "..."`

## Pull requests as a triage surface

**PRs as a request surface: no.** _(Set to `yes` if this repo treats external PRs as feature requests; `/triage` reads this flag.)_

When set to `yes`, PRs run through the same labels and states as issues, using the `gh pr` equivalents:

- **Read a PR**: `gh pr view <number> --comments` and `gh pr diff <number>` for the diff.
- **List external PRs for triage**: `gh pr list --state open --json number,title,body,labels,author,authorAssociation,comments`
  then keep only `authorAssociation` of `CONTRIBUTOR`, `FIRST_TIME_CONTRIBUTOR`, or `NONE`
  (drop `OWNER`/`MEMBER`/`COLLABORATOR`).
- **Comment / label / close**: `gh pr comment`, `gh pr edit --add-label`/`--remove-label`, `gh pr close`.

GitHub shares one number space across issues and PRs, so a bare `#42` may be either —
resolve with `gh pr view 42` and fall back to `gh issue view 42`.

## When a skill says "publish to the issue tracker"

Create a GitHub issue on `vmxmy/wechat-article-exporter`.

## When a skill says "fetch the relevant ticket"

Run `gh issue view <number> --repo vmxmy/wechat-article-exporter --comments`.

## Wayfinding operations

Used by `/wayfinder`. The **map** is a single issue with **child** issues as tickets.

- **Map**: a single issue labelled `wayfinder:map`, holding the Notes / Decisions-so-far / Fog body.
- **Child ticket**: an issue linked to the map as a GitHub sub-issue (`gh api` on the sub-issues endpoint).
  Where sub-issues aren't enabled, add the child to a task list in the map body and put `Part of #<map>`
  at the top of the child body. Labels: `wayfinder:<type>` (`research`/`prototype`/`grilling`/`task`).
  Once claimed, the ticket is assigned to the driving dev.
- **Blocking**: GitHub's **native issue dependencies**. Add an edge with
  `gh api --method POST repos/vmxmy/wechat-article-exporter/issues/<child>/dependencies/blocked_by -F issue_id=<blocker-db-id>`,
  where `<blocker-db-id>` is the blocker's numeric **database id**
  (`gh api repos/vmxmy/wechat-article-exporter/issues/<n> --jq .id`, _not_ the `#number` or `node_id`).
  GitHub reports `issue_dependencies_summary.blocked_by` (open blockers only — the live gate).
  Where dependencies aren't available, fall back to a `Blocked by: #<n>, #<n>` line at the top of the child body.
  A ticket is unblocked when every blocker is closed.
- **Frontier query**: list the map's open children, drop any with an open blocker
  (`issue_dependencies_summary.blocked_by > 0`) or an assignee; first in map order wins.
- **Claim**: `gh issue edit <n> --repo vmxmy/wechat-article-exporter --add-assignee @me` — the session's first write.
- **Resolve**: `gh issue comment <n>`, then `gh issue close <n>`, then append a context pointer to the map's Decisions-so-far.
